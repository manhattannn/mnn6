NAB, National Association of Broadcasters, holds an annual conference in Las Vegas bringing together television stations from all over the world.

More specifically we tackle several areas. Geoff looked at field cameras and microphones. Hector researched new Master Control equipment to keep us on the air, Tyrone had meetings with just about everyone (CG, switching, routing) and I primarily focused on automation systems. </p><p>Hector, Tyrone and I focused on many of the &quot;behind the scenes&quot; aspects of MNN. Items like playout automation and video routing. I also looked at new CG (Character Generator) systems to replace our hideous On-air schedule (I can&#39;t wait to get rid of that old system). Many of the items were looked at are not the most glamorous pieces of television production but are absolutely necessary in order to keep MNN on the air. We are also looking to move MNN into the digital future away from VHS and into full Digital files. </p><p>In order to reach that digital goal, however, we have a lot of hurdles to overcome and even more planning. With 8 playout channels (4 on Time Warner and 4 on RCN) playing 24x7x365 with few repeats their is a lot of equipment, cabling and racks involved not to mention several companies and vendors.

It's really just mapping nodes. (Though I was surprised to notice it recognises devices by protocol, well, printers anyway.)  <br /><br />The crescent on the upper right are the existing streaming servers in the DMZ, although Intermapper is oddly assigning them staff network IPs as well. Hmm, I should probably look into that.   And I will just as soon as Intermapper finishes... mapping our entire class B network. Of which we are using fewer than a dozen addresses. (Picture after the jump…)<br /><br />Interestingly, it puts all the printers in their own ring (top left) which I at first had thought would be the server subnet. That&#39;s interesting since network printers aren&#39;t assigned by IP, but apparently Intermapper recognises them by protocol, similar to the way Growl or Bonjour recognise devices by protocol. (Um, yeah, there's a lot of Macs on this network.)<br /><br />  Here&#39;s the pretty picture Intermapper generated for our network. I was especially interested in how it would represent the cascading switches, but the actual map is more eye candy than anything useful for network administration.

"ACM 2008";"1216008000";"1217374856";"Just got back from a week in Washington at the Alliance for Community Media conference. Well I got back on Saturday but I pretty much took all of yesterday to recuperate. 

The best sessions at the conference were, of course, the Drupal one, and also the last session on Social Media 2.0. (It was nice that social media wasn't looked on as the red headed step child of the conference this year.) 

It would have been great however if the conference had had working WiFi so participants could have tweeted the session highlights in real time. That obviously works better than trying to 'summize' after the fact. (btw Twitter just bought summize today, which you probably heard.)

I was mainly on the social media and technology track, but one of the main points of focus of the conference in general was the changes that 'PEG' stations are being subject to by the collusion of big media and all too easily bought federal and state regulators. In particular, the losses in all 20 states who were pressured into passing laws that further drain what limited PEG resources there are into already burgeoning big media coffers was viewed as a grave setback. Not included in those 20 is Hawaii where they adopted a new State level certification program as an alternate way of strangling access centers. There were easily 20 people from Hawaii at the conference who came to draw attention to their situation. 

There is obviously the desire to roll back the grave blows to PEG centers in those 20 states, as well as the lessons that can be learned to staunch future blood flow in other states. 

At the Federal level, one key point is how it's understood that PEG currently has a minority (2) of the FCC commissioners who really understand what's at stake, while the remaining 3 commissioners, who vote as a majority, seem to be more aligned with big media. It's really critical that this ratio is reversed, and potentially, a new administration next year may make this possible. 

There was also considerable discussion of \"Web2.3.0.x or whatever it is\" (which was actually how it was referred to, haha) with the observation that many PEG centers are less afraid of it than they once were. The current flap in Congress over restricting representative's access to social media sites illustrates a parallel situation perfectly. 

But there was a social media track for the first time including demonstrations of Second Life (!!!) as well as a session that covered Twitter led by a PEG ED who confessed \"Frankly I don't get Twitter.\" And of course there was very little Twittering owing to that lack of WiFi. 

For my part, if I had to break it down to the executive summary, it would be something like \"Evolve or Die\" which sounds pretty grim, but unfortunately does seem to reflect the current state of PEG. Still there was much rejoicing and celebration, and hopefully a few eyes opened along the way, in addition to those raised eyebrows. "
"NTS: Please Don't Update Servers 1st Thing Monday Morning";"1207578625";"1216945504";"Note to Self: Please don't do server updates first thing Monday morning. 

After updating the Domain Controllers to the latest OS X, I noticed web pages were loading painfully slow(ly) most likely due to a dns issue, obv. For some reason the master dns server was turned off during the upgrade from 10.4.10 to 10.4.11 and everything was bouncing over to the slave server. Kind of a strange anomaly, but still not the kind of problem you want competing with your first cup of coffee on Monday morning. BTW if you have servers still running 10.4.10, you may want to upgrade since there are security issues. 

Also first thing this morning the MMN website schedule is off by an hour again. It looks like Ocean Se7en is still auto-adjusting twice a year for the old DST changes. So this means until Ocean Se7en goes away, DST changes have to be hand-coded 4 not 2 times a year. Once for each of the DST changes, and then adjusted again when O7 *thinks* the switch is supposed to occur. Did I mention I really dislike DST?"

Still glad I didn't go ahead and fix it remotely from Boston, things always go wrong when you least expect it, yanno.  "
"FiOS Goes Live Today";"1217254972";"1217373888";"Today Verizon officially rolls out FiOS TV here in New York City. They're having a schmancy ceremony at Grand Central which will be webcast (not on MNN.) As you may known, NYC granted Verizon a television franchise in the city back in May which was just confirmed on July 16th by the New York Public Service Commission. As part of the deal, Verizon will pay franchise fees for use of city infrastructure, a portion of which goes to fund MNN, which provides universal access and programming to all Manhattan residents (other burroughs each have their own networks.) 

Verizon has also indicated they will quickly be moving into web video: <a href=\"http://newteevee.com/2008/07/25/verizon-fios-gets-into-web-video/\" title=\"Verizon to offer web video\">Web video over FiOS</a>"
"Broadband  Advisory Committee meeting next Wednesday.";"1216872000";"1217355207";"Next Wednesday, July 30th at 11:00am there will be a briefing
 from the Mayor's Office and Diamond Consultants for the Broadband
 Advisory Committee regarding the Bloomberg Administration's plans for
 bridging the digital divide in New York City.

 The Broadband Advisory Committee was established in 2005 with the
 passage of Introduction 625-A creating a joint public broadband
 commission to advise the Mayor and the City Council of New York on how
 the resources of City government can be used to stimulate the private
 market so that residents and businesses of New York City have more
 options in terms of high-speed Internet access.  The goal of the
 committee is to educate the general public about broadband and the
 newest communication technologies, and to give New York City residents
 the opportunity to comment on how the digital divide in New York City
 can be closed.  To support these efforts the Broadband Advisory
 Committee has held public Broadband Hearings in the Bronx, Brooklyn,
 Manhattan, and Queens. The Committee will hold its fifth and final
 hearing in Staten Island this fall.

 Diamond Consultants was hired by the New York City Economic Development
 Corporation to determine the breadth of the digital divide in New York
 City and develop programs and initiatives to provide greater digital
 inclusion for all residents. Chris O'Brien, a Partner in Diamond's
 Public Sector practice, will be detailing Diamond's findings and its
 recommendations for the City's next steps.

 The meeting will take place in the Committee of the Whole Room, City
 Hall, New York, NY on Wednesday, July 30th at 11:00 am. This is a public
 meeting and all are welcome to attend. For further information please
 contact Kunal Malhotra, Director of Legislation & Budget, 212-788-6975

"Apple’s well kept Xsan secret.";"1203483600";"1217375652";"Pretty funny coincidence that not even a week after we decided not to go with an Apple Xsan storage solution --for reasons that are best left unsaid-- Apple made the annoucement they would no longer be making their own raid hardware but would be outsourcing the chassis to Promise.  Or rather buying Promise. Or something. 

Anyway, best left unsaid doesn't have to mean unsaid, and so the truth was that we caught a different rumour that Google video was using Rourke hw on the backend of their XSan MDC's, because it just out-performed the Apple stuff.  Hard to bleeve isn’t it. 

But the really amazing reason for that didn't appear til after the Promise announcement. Apple never made the jump to SATA. They were still using unserialised drives right up to the day the closed the division. In 2008. The clock stopped for Apple XSan long ago. Just don't tell that to the NFL (who recently had Apple whip them up a 2-4 Petabyte Xsan storage array.)  

Having said that, their hw is real pretty, if you you’re the sort who likes sitting roung all day staring at blinking lights and blue neon.

"Um, are you sure you don’t mean geek?";"1201669200";"1217375941";"\"You really are a nerd.\" he said. 

I looked at him quizzically. 

\"No, I mean you know your stuff.\" he quickly corrected, catching the look in my eye. 

\"In a nerdy way?\" I asked.

\"Yes, right. Exactly.\" 

\"Um, are you sure you don’t mean geek?\" 

It's such an obvious distinction. So it never fails to amaze me when people completely miss it.

"The Internet is Serious Business";"1222829669";"1222877948";"<p>This isn&#39;t the first time an alien has visited earth on a fact-finding mission. They&#39;ve been coming here for hundreds of years, studying our planetary communications systems. The alien is grey with elongated fingers and toes, has an insatiable curiosity, and is the star of the CUP produced film &quot;The Internet is Serious Business&quot; which had it&#39;s premiere at Anthology Film Achives tonight. <br /></p><p>[img_assist|nid=4535|title=The Internet is Serious Business|desc=|link=node|align=left|width=251|height=188] <br />The alien conceit (the alien is totally adorable, btw) takes what could easily be a snooze-fest --an examination of Internet access, the &quot;digital divide&quot; and technology governance issues-- and whips them into an entertaining and informative mix that is truly all ages. Claymation Internet packets and clever youthisms will keep kids&#39; attention while the subject matter at hand with it&#39;s related, thorny questions of who &#39;controls&#39; the internet provides food for thought for adults and geeks.</p><p>&quot;The Internet is Serious Business&quot; (which takes it&#39;s title, not-surprisingly, from a popular Internet meme catch-phrase) was produced by the Center for Urban Pedagogy (CUP) with assistance from Manhattan Neighborhood Network, and features MNN&#39;s previous IT Director, Damien Barrett, who explains broadband infrastructure to the visiting extra-terrestrial. (Disclaimer: I was invited to participate in that interview but had a scheduling conflict.)</p><p> CUP Teaching Artist Helki Frantzen and students from City-As-School worked with the People’s Production House Digital Expansion Initiative to produce this video about the huge networks of cables, routers, and servers that we call the Internet. <br />The screening was followed by a panel discussion with spectrum advocate Dharma Dailey, People’s Production House Policy Director Josh Breitbart, and others who worked on the project.

"High Def Expo is Def";"1222371335";"1222896848";"<p>I&#39;m at the HD Expo today. It&#39;s the first time it&#39;s been held in New York (it will also be repeated in LA next month&lt;&gt;) and is happening at the Waterfront, which you seasoned NYers may remember from it&#39;s halcyon days as The Tunnel, and scene of more than a few filmings. Whenever a TV show (or film) needed to have a scene in a club, they invariable filmed it in The Tunnel. <br /><br />So it&#39;s oddly appropriate to have all the HD cameras set up all over, not to mention having the likes of John Gilroy, (ACE &quot;Michael Clayton&quot;) and Steve Wax here to discuss branded entertainment and viral campaigns such as for True Blood, the latter in the session on &quot;<strong>A Conversation About Revolution and What’s Next: Telling Stories, Branding and Community In A State of Change&quot;</strong> </p><p><br />The sessions I&#39;m mainly interested in are the ones on Building a Content Delivery Network for Internet TV, which is ultimately what the Open Media Project is aiming at, as well as the CS4 preview, a 2 hour intensive that proved Adobe&#39;s latest release isnt&#39; nearly as bad as its new logo might lead you to believe. There was also an exciting session dedicated to Sports Networks; since I see a day when MNN will have a dedicated sports channel for inner-city sports. <br /><br />The CDN intensive was sponsored by NeuLion, who showcased their product, but also covered a wide range of solutions from IPTV to &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_television&quot; title=&quot;It differs from IPTV in that IPTV offerings are typically offered on discrete service provider networks,requiring a special IPTV set-top-box&quot;&gt;Internet TV&lt;/a&gt; And I was frankly impressed at the balance struck between board room jargon with an understanding of the underlying technolgies.&quot; (Corporate jargon alert: &quot;What&#39;s the uplift on that?&quot;) <br /><br />The session covered a complete HD workflow from signal aquisition and encoding where the signal is simultaneously aquired and ingested (into a profile) all the way to the various approaches to web playout such as CDN populating strategies (eg. deep-caching vs. peering.) This last piece is the one thing that not yet part of the &lt;&gt;Open Media Platform.&lt;&gt;  One trend you&#39;ve probably noticed if you&#39;ve paid any attention to Internet TV approaches is that the old model of show syndication is giving way to one of *player* syndication (eg. Facebook.) </p><p> I&#39;ll address these topics in more detail later as well as highlights from the CS4 preview. Keep Watching! <br /></p>"
"Hemispheric Collaboration: Internet Bill of Rights";"1223593868";"1223593883";"<p>I&#39;m downtown at what&#39;s being called an historic event: a real time, intercontinental collaborative construction of an Internet Bill of Rights which is taking place in New York and simultaneously in South America. This collaborative effort to create a consensus of agreement on a set of essential rights for the Internet was done using custom software that allowed the participants, working in small groups, to make suggestions for inclusion in an Internet Bill of Rights, edit each other suggestions, and then &#39;endorse&#39; any groups contributions by adding their group&#39;s icon to any of the suggestions. The collaboration was also faciliated by simultaneous machine translation between English and Spanish. The workshop went on for about 90 minutes at which time edits and endorsements were locked. Here&#39;s the collaborative page as it was when the session ended. <br /></p><p><a href=\"http://fsa.mayfirst.org/\" title=\"Collaborative Internet Bill of Rights\">http://fsa.mayfirst.org/ </a><br /></p><p>The program works by allowing you to suggest planks in an Internet Bill of Rights (which are simultaneously translated into Spanish) each group can read all of the contributions and decide whether to add their groups icon as an endorsement of that right. Any group can also edit any other right suggested by any group. After any list item is edited, it drops the item to the bottom of the list and resets all the endorsements. <br /><br />There&#39;s actually a lot more information there of course than what you can see without having registered to participate. A participant aka &#39;scribe&#39; can see for example a history of endorsements which may have been lost when the item was edited. In the debriefing that followed the suggestion was made to be able to view items by their endorsement history so that a scribe could view the most endorsed version of a particular item. <br /></p><p>I was pleasantly surprised to find that also participating is one of the principal developers of MNN&#39;s Open Media codebase, and also DKG who co-wrote the collaboration software we used today, and who recently has helped with server configuration at MNN.  The other programmer of the collaboration program were Jamie of MayFirst who administer all of MNN&#39;s mailing lists and Mallory from Brecht forum (who reminded me to come or I might have missed it!) <br />  </p><p>Also there was Thomas L. from ConnectingNYC.org, which is one of the two organisations working hard to make the .nyc top level domain a reality. (it actually already is a *virtual* reality, as there already are a number of .nyc websites…) He mentioned there will be a meeting about the .nyc domain held by Gale Brewer next Friday October 17th at 10AM. </p>"
