"Looking Back and Moving Forward: A Year in the Fight to Save Public Access TV!";"1166650579";"1167867024";"<div style=\"display: block; clear: right\">  [img_assist|nid=606|title=|desc=|link=none|align=left|width=160|height=127]   </div> <p>Back in September 2005, a cluster of anti-Community Access TV legislation emerged in the Washington—and we faced the greatest threat to Public Access TV in its thirty-five year history. Today, after fifteen months of campaigning and organizing by MNN’s producers, supporters, <a href=\"http://www.saveaccess.org\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Save Access website\">saveaccess.org</a>, and our community allies, the threat is still real—but we have a clearer understanding of what may happen in the future. In recent months, since the Congressional Bills have been stalled, the telephone companies have been putting their efforts into lobbying for a statewide franchise system—and attack Public Access TV and the local franchising in this way.</p>    <p>Here’s an update on our campaign efforts to Save Public Access TV on the local, state and national level:</p>  <h4>What’s happening nationally?</h4>  <p>On June 8th, the House or Representatives passed the Communications Opportunity, Promotion, and Enhancement Act of 2006 (COPE Act) by 269 votes to 152. A companion bill immediately followed in the Senate’s Commerce Committee. But the Senate bill introduced by Senator Ted Stevens (R- Alaska)—currently called the “Advanced Telecommunications, Opportunity and Reform” act or “ATOR” (HR5252)—has met resistance. Nationwide, the ATOR’ Bill’s stumbling block has been the bill’s failure to protect Internet Net Neutrality—savetheinternet.com claims over a million people have spoken out against the bill. In addition, for the last year the Public Access TV community has been well organized. We have mobilized grassroots support for Public, Educational, and Governmental Access (PEG), met with elected officials in Washington, organized national protests and dozens of cities have passed resolution against these Congressional bills.  We have made important strides in getting Congress to recognize that Public Access TV is a crucial part of our democracy. Save Access mobilized 10,000 people to write their Senators through the saveaccess.org website.</p>    <p>If passed, the ATOR bill will end the local franchising system that currently pays for PEG TV, and replace it with a new national franchising system controlled by the FCC in Washington. The bill would also allow phone companies to “economically redline” low-income and rural communities, denying service to less “profitable” areas.  The national franchising system proposed by the ATOR bill would be unresponsive to the needs of local communities.  However, it does—in its current form—provide some funding for PEG. </p>    <p>Senator Stevens intended to force a vote on the bill during this past lame-duck political session following the November elections—but his efforts lost momentum.  Now, the bill automatically dies since it was not passed this session.  Experts are speculating that since Democrats now control the House and Senate, the phone companies may not lobby as hard to pass these bills in Congress and will instead push aggressively to pass video franchises state by state.  The phone companies have already spent more than $100 million on lobbying Congress, ads, campaign contributions, and astroturfs and it was the power of the people who mobilized to oppose these bills that were able to stall it.</p>    <h4>What’s happening locally?[img_assist|nid=604|title=|desc=|link=none|align=right|width=121|height=141]</h4>    <p>In a strange local turn-around on August 14th, a high-power team from Verizon—the company pushing to end local franchising nationwide—pitched the NYC City Council for a local franchise. This would allow them to bring video services to the city, and would end Time Warner and Cablevision’s long monopoly of NYC cable services by allowing for multiple local franchises.</p>    <p>Late in September the City Council approved Resolution 197 by a vote of 48-0—thereby allowing new video service providers, such as phone companies into the market. The resolution states, all new franchises shall include “provisions requiring capacity and support for public, educational, and governmental access”. Time Warner and Cablevision said they welcome the competition as long as the phone company plays by the same franchise rules as the incumbent operators.</p>    <p>If Verizon enters the marketplace, bringing in new revenue and customers, it could lead to increased money for public access TV—and new channels or audiences. Verizon is already stringing fiber-optic cables in some NYC neighborhoods, such as Long Island and plans to spend billions to reach the city’s 3 million homes and apartments.  However it is unclear if Verizon will agree to “build out” and provide its’ services to entire neighborhoods in NYC.  In addition, a Verizon spokesperson made it clear that although the company is negotiating selected local franchises, it will not end its nationwide effort to end the local franchising system.</p>    <h4>What’s happening statewide?[img_assist|nid=602|title=|desc=|link=none|align=right|width=116|height=125]</h4>    <p>One top phone-company lobbyist recently indicated that if national franchising legislation did not pass this year, Verizon would plan to push for statewide franchising legislation in New York, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania—the company’s three largest markets now without statewide franchises.  To date, statewide video franchising legislation has already passed in New Jersey, California, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Virginia along with several other states.</p>    <p>In May 2006, NY State Assemblyman Richard Brodsky introduced one such statewide franchising bill. Although there has been no movement on Brodsky’s Assembly bill 11529—it seems likely the campaign to save access will soon need to focus its efforts on Albany and on building a statewide network of public access TV supporters.</p>    <h4>What’s ahead in the future for Public Access TV?</h4>    <p>At a NYC Council hearing on Community Access TV on September 14th, dozens turned out to once again remind the Council of public access TV’s importance. Without MNN “we wouldn’t be able to bring the issues our organization faces to the public’s attention”, said Jean Rice of Picture the Homeless. Rice added, “Picture the Homeless has used public access TV to focus public scrutiny on the deplorable conditions inside the city’s homeless Emergency Assistance Unit, and to counter the NYPD’s illegal fingerprinting of homeless New Yorkers.” With support for public access TV at an all-time high among Council members, the push was on to provide a vision for the future of community media in the city. “This hearing could not come at a more important time. New York City is in danger of falling behind the rest of the country and the world in ensuring that all of the city’s residents, and all of the city’s diverse neighborhoods and community organizations, have access to high-tech broadband services and skills—and that their voices are heard on the critical issues of the day”, testified MNN&#39;s Executive Director Dan Coughlin.</p>    <p>The introduction of broadband services is transforming the possibilities for ‘greenspace’ of community media in the public interest. Vlogging, Community Internet, Internet radio, and a variety of other broadband uses, signal a host of new possibilities for democratic communication and grassroots media justice.</p>    <p>With the NYC Council exhibiting high levels of support for public access TV, it’s a good time to begin developing our vision of community media and other communication needs for the future—and to start working with local elected representatives to make this vision become a reality.</p>  <h4>What can you do?</h4>    <p>In the coming New Year, we will be creating statewide organizing materials and on-line tools for our community allies, Access producers and concerned citizens to take action to oppose statewide video franchise bills.</p>    <p>Please check <a href=\"http://www.saveaccess.org\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Save Access website\">www.saveaccess.org</a> for regular updates and ways you can get involved in the campaign.</p> "

"MNN Envisions Community Media and Public Access TV in the 21st Century";"1168995131";"1169667621";"<div align=\"center\">[img_assist|nid=597|title=|desc=|link=none|align=left|width=127|height=98]</div><div align=\"center\"> </div> <div align=\"left\"><p>MNN Envisions Community Media and Public Access TV in the 21st Century: Launching Our Franchise Renewal in 2008</p></div>       <p>Manhattan Neighborhood Network (MNN) continues to be the vehicle for thousands of community based groups and individuals to inform and express their viewpoints on different issues. </p> As the demand for mass global communication and alternative media increases there is a bigger need for communities of color and low-income communities to be able to keep up and be part of the information highway. Now more than ever, it is important  to defend community media and Public, Educational and Governmental Access Centers (PEG) which allow us to have a voice in the media landscape.  Nationally, there are 1.2 million volunteers and 250,000 community organizations that create programming for PEG Access channels – together they produce 20,000 hours of new and local program a week, more than all the major networks combined.<br /><br />In the last fifteen months, MNN has been working with coalitions, such as <a href=\"http://www.saveaccess.org\" target=\"_blank\">Saveaccess.org </a>in an effort to bring awareness to the public about what the phone companies are doing to take away local control PEG Access Centers in cities and localities through federal and statewide franchise legislation. The major forces behind this overhaul legislation are the rapid changes and convergence of digital technologies with the introduction of broadband Internet service —a service that will blur the traditional boundaries between cable TV, phone service and the Internet. Essentially, phone companies do not want to pay local franchise fees for using the “public-rights-of-way”. The legislation also doesn’t have “build-out” requirements which would allow phone companies to “redline” low-income and rural communities, denying broadband service to these communities and furthering the digital divide.   Local franchise fees make PEG Access possible, but the phone companies don’t want to be accountable to our local communities and local government. Free speech, local control and PEG Access have been under attack as phone companies try to pass overhaul legislation that would further de-regulate the media industry, increase corporate mergers of media giants like AT&amp;T and Bellsouth and destroy our local public interest media. <br /><br />At the end of the 2006, the legislation has stalled in Washington, and now the phone companies are now trying to pass “statewide” franchises. In more than a dozen states statewide franchise legislation have been adopted or proposed, having the same negative impact on Public Access TV. And now in another devastating blow to PEG Access, it looks like the FCC has taken a favorable position to the telcos, supporting the elimination of local franchises and local control of PEG Access.<br /><br />   <p><strong>Local franchises: Why are they important for Public Access TV?</strong></p>It is also critical for New Yorkers to be aware of the important role of that PEG Access plays in our media democracy and how Public Access TV centers operate through the local franchise renewal process.There are nine cable franchises in the City covering all five boroughs. All cable franchises in the City are owned and controlled by either Time Warner Cable (TWC) or Cablevision. These franchises agreements all expire in 2008.  <br /><br />A local franchise is an agreement between a city, town, or region and a telecommunication company. It basically says that in return for running their cables on streets and publicly owned property (called the Public-Rights-Of-Way) a telecommunications company must pay rent and agree to certain local stipulations—such as responding to consumer complaints, serving all people who request service (Universal Service), providing channel space and resources for Community Access TV, and supporting the educational Institutional Network (I-Net). Local franchises ensure that telecommunications companies pay fair compensation to local communities for using the publicly owned infrastructure—they are an important way of making sure these huge corporations are responsive to local needs and consumer complaints—and the local franchising system is based on the principal that local communities should be able to govern themselves.<br /><br />MNN is responsible for administering the Public Access cable television services in Manhattan. MNN purpose is to ensure the ability of Manhattan residents to exercise their First Amendment rights through the medium of cable television and to create opportunities for mutual communication, education, artistic expression and other noncommercial uses of video facilities on an open, uncensored and equitable basis.  In providing services, MNN seeks to involve the diverse racial, ethnic and geographic communities of Manhattan in the electronic communication of their varied interests, needs, concerns and identities.  MNN, the Public Access Television in Manhattan is financially supported by Time Warner Cable and RCN Cable, under a franchise agreement with the City of New York.  MNN facilities and services are used by thousands of individuals who work hard for the opportunity of bringing information, education and entertainment to other New Yorkers.  You would never see such a diverse array of local programming in the corporate media.<br /><br />In September 2006, the New York City Council unanimously voted to approve an authorizing resolution to negotiate new franchise agreements with cable/video companies. All cable franchise holders are subject to comparable obligations and requirements.  Essentially, all video service providers, including phone companies , would  have to obey by the same provisions requiring capacity and support for Public Access TV through local franchises.<br /><br /> <p><strong>MNN’s Next Steps: We Need Your Participation to Ensure the Future of Public Access TV!</strong></p> <p>MNN is currently working to make sure we have a successful franchise renewal agreement in 2008 that will protect and expand our PEG Access TV needs, and ensure access to cutting edge technology for all Manhattan residents.   <br /><br />One major step in this franchise renewal process is undergoing a Community Needs Assessment.  This involves community planning meetings with MNN’s stakeholders, community residents, and community based organizations, elected officials, city agencies, and Manhattan residents to gather feedback and information that will help MNN provide services to meet the PEG Access, technology and communications needs of Manhattan residents and groups - now and in the future. MNN’s goal is to make sure our 2008 renewal franchise agreement guarantees that communities remain on the cutting-edge of new technologies and are included in this digital age of information.  Our new franchise negotiations  aim to protect current and future funding for PEG Access channels and their facilities.  <br /><br />We will keep you posted on pending federal and New York State legislation that could undermine funding and local control of Public Access TV.  All citizens and community organizations have a key role to play in our franchise renewal process and in the fight against anti-Access legislation.  We will be calling on your participation in this process in the coming weeks and months. We hope you will be able to attend the Community Planning Meetings to evaluate the communication and Public Access TV needs of Manhattan residents and organizations during March 2007.

That FCC ruling went far deeper than the failed Congressional legislation of last year in attacking Public, Educational, and Governmental (PEG) Access channels and facilities. It also threatens local municipalities ability to exercise control over their &#39;rights of way&quot; and provides little protection against the red-lining of entire communities. Worse of all, the FCC hearing on the matter was rife with inaccuracies and half-truths that even the phone companies backed away from. Such behavior by a Federal agency is reprehensible and we demand full accountability now! </p><p><br />The many organizations representing cities, along with the Alliance for Community Media, have promised a lawsuit - but we need for the Senate to hear from the people and for them to respond accordingly.

In fact, I just responded to two emails from students in South Korea who were studying public access (MNN is mentioned in textbooks in South Korea!)</p><p>- <strong>That Big Networks like CBS and ESPN are surprised by the amount of content we air.</strong> Seriously. I have talked with people from many of the large networks and they are amazed that with such a small staff we are able to receive, play, and manage the volume of programming that we do. Our Programming staff of just over 10 people handles a flow of 150 pieces of media and the scheduling of over 80 hours of original programming every day! It is a feat that is matched by only a few television stations in the world! </p>  <p>I am proud to go to these conferences to represent and talk about Manhattan Neighborhood Network. The services we provide are unmatched by anyone in the world and how we are able to provide them on our relatively small budget is amazing. What makes MNN really great though is YOU! The producers of MNN provide amazing material that quickly becomes known around the nation and often around the world. </p> <p>We may only cablecast within the borough of Manhattan but the work is known worldwide because we stream live online. You are the reason!</p> <p>Wait.. did you just say you weren&#39;t a producer? What are you waiting for... come in, <a href=\"/producers/new/ilive\">get training and get on air</a>! </p> <p>&nbsp;</p>"

Her special assignment was to speak for the interests of our producers because she had been one herself for many years. AGEWISE, her program made with and about seniors, was recognized as &quot;outstanding&quot; at the Home Town Festival of the Alliance for Community Media and continues to be used as a model by trainers in access centers across the country.<br /><br /> Ruth&#39;s background as a professional gave her the technical skills required to produce a polished show. Yet she never let her own experience dominate the set or the editing room. She had the skill -- and the humanity -- to make even the most frightened or unsure guests appear at their best and get their message across. While no one can replace her fully she leaves with us a great many media makers who will continue to honor her memory by following her example.</em></p> <p><em>-George C.

The team also drew from a wide range of sources — including the U.S. census, records from three city agencies, and private data on real estate sales — to describe and analyze demographic trends and flows of investment in local real estate.<br /> <br /> “The goals of the research project were to identify and explain changing forces, highlight concerns of local residents, and propose practical courses of action for positive future development,” explained Hope’s Executive Director, Robin LeBaron. “We hope the film and panel discussion will shed new light on the issue of displacement and lay the foundation for an alliance with local partners to preserve East Harlem’s historic standing as a vibrant, affordable neighborhood for working class families.”<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /></p>"

MEETING RESISTANCE raises the veil of anonymity surrounding the Iraqi insurgency by meeting face to face with individuals who are passionately engaged in the struggle, and documenting for the very first time, the sentiments experienced and actions taken by a nation&#39;s citizens when their homeland is occupied. Voices that have previously not been heard, male and female, speak candidly about their motivations, hopes and goals, revealing a kaleidoscope of human perspectives. Featuring reflective, yet fervent conversations with active insurgents, MEETING RESISTANCE is the missing puzzle piece in understanding the Iraq war. Directed by Steve Connors and Molly Bingham, this daring, eye-opening film provides unique insight into the personal narratives of people involved in the resistance, exploding myth after myth about the war in Iraq and the Iraqis who participate. Through its unprecedented access to these clandestine groups, MEETING RESISTANCE focuses the spotlight on the &quot;other side,&quot; leaving the viewer with clarity as to why the violence in Iraq continues to this day.  <br /><br />For more info, to see the trailer and more, go to http://www.meetingresistance.org/<br /><br /></p>"

But when it comes to<br />the Internet, we&#39;re working to catch up to other jurisdictions</strong></em>,&quot; said<br />Council Member Brewer, Chair of the New York City Council&#39;s Committee<br />on Technology in Government. Brewer sponsored Local Law 126, which<br />created the NYC Broadband Advisory Committee. &quot;I am excited to work<br />with the Mayor&#39;s Office in making New York a place where you don&#39;t have<br />to pay to go slow. We need affordable high-speed Internet connections<br />to bring in jobs, help schools, and make the city safer.&quot;<br /><br />According to the Pew Internet and American Life Project, 27% of<br />American households are still not using the Internet at all and &quot;those<br />with less education, those with lower household incomes, and Americans<br />age 65 and older are less likely to have embraced broadband than those<br />who are younger and have higher socio-economic status.&quot; Seeking to<br />address these same imbalances, Broadband Advisory Committee<br />Chairperson, Shaun Belle, and CEO of Mount Hope Housing Company said,<br />&quot;Understanding the challenges to Broadband connectivity for the average<br />New Yorker is a primary focus of the Broadband Advisory Committee;<br />exploring and potentially implementing solutions to address these<br />challenges will be the basis of our future planning.&quot;<br /><br />Andrew Rasiej, an Advisory Committee Member and the Founder of the<br />Personal Democracy Forum and MOUSE said, &quot;These hearings are critical<br />to focusing broad political attention and building consensus for the<br />need to guarantee all New Yorkers an opportunity to participate in the<br />21st Century economy.&quot;<br /><br />The New York Broadband Advisory Committee was created by [2]Local Law<br />126, a bill sponsored by Council Member Gale Brewer. The purpose of the<br />Committee is to advise the Mayor and the City Council on how to bring<br />affordable high-speed Internet connection to all New York City<br />residents, nonprofit organizations and businesses.

This exhibition is a challenging presentation that provides<br />privileged glimpses of ephemeral live actions by both well-known and<br />little-known artists. Using a rich and lively gathering of film, video,<br />photographs, texts, ephemera, costumes, props, and artworks related to<br />significant works, as well as by presenting live performance and public<br />programs, this exhibition will be a landmark in the documentation of action<br />art. The recipient of a prestigious 2006 Emily Hall Tremaine Exhibition<br />Award, Arte no es vida has been forecasted to be one of the ³most important<br />exhibitions of 2008² by The Art Newspaper, and international publication.<br />Through a chronological hanging, in which each decade is presented through<br />various constellations or themes (such as destruction, ritual, blood, the<br />body and the land, political protest, the task, the walk, gender, feminism,<br />endurance, AIDS, wearables, the quincentenary, and social sculpture) viewers<br />will be able to explore both the interconnections of these artists to the<br />canonical Western history of artist&#39;s actions, as well as their different<br />and specific trajectories.

It also provides hundreds of hours of programming for the channels that reflects the borough’s diversity.<br /><br />In 2008, twenty organizations representing a wide array of cultural, youth, community-based, media arts, immigrant, social service and social justice groups in Manhattan, were awarded grants ranging from $2,000 to $15,000 in three categories.<br /><br />They include: Art For Change, Children for Children, Coalition of Institutionalized, Aged and Disabled (CIAD), Disabilities Network of NYC, Educational Video Center, Esperanza del Barrio, Immigrant Social Services, Union Settlement and Vision Urbana.<br /><br />Since its inception, MNN’s Community Media Grant Program has awarded $3 million dollars to over one hundred non-profit organizations. These groups have produced groundbreaking video projects, bringing thousands of hours of informational, cultural, artistic and community-based programming to MNN’s four public access channels.  <br /><br />The groups funded in the past represent the rich cultural, ethnic and racial diversity across Manhattan – from Alianza Dominicana in Washington Heights to Chica Luna Productions in East Harlem to the Junior Scholars Program at the Schomburg Center in Central Harlem to Chinese Staff &amp; Workers’ Association in Chinatown. <br /><br />Other organizations funded since 1993 include the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Center, the Lower East Side Girls Club, National Mobilization Against Sweatshops, Picture the Homeless, Housing Works, Harlem School of the Arts, Women Make Movies, American Indian Community House, Nuyorican Poets Café, and Interreligious Foundation for Community Organization. To read the full list of grantees from the last 15 years go to: http://www.mnn.org/en/grantees<br /><br />The following is a complete list of the grant areas and grantees funded this year-in 2008:<br /><br />The Curatorial Media grant area recognizes the vast local and national resources of new and archival programming that breaks with traditional media boundaries. The grant provides organizations with the necessary resources to curate innovative and thematic presentations within contemporary contexts that help inform and educate specific communities and the general public. These special curated programs will be cablecasted on MNN’s public access channels.  Funded groups this year are: Sprout, ACT UP Oral History Project, Art For Change, Deep Dish TV, Educational Video Center on behalf of Urban Visionaries Film Festival, Paper Tiger TV, and Rooftop Films.<br /><br />Tactical Media Toolkit grant area is designed to provide organizations with media resources to respond to community needs. The grant provides a strategic video production and post-production equipment package to the organization, enabling them to produce broadcast television programming virtually anywhere. Funding groups are Children for Children, City At Peace, Disabilities Network of NYC, Immigrant Social Services, Kids Creative, The New York Independent Media Center, and Union Settlement.<br /><br />The Training and Production grant area is designed to provide organizations with the resources to develop a self-sufficient media production capability. The grant provides for a trainer/mentor to work directly with an organization. The grant also places video production and post-production equipment at the organizations facility. The grant is designed to encourage the integration of media within the overall framework of the organization, develop a level of sustainable media capacity and produce programming for playback on MNN’s public access channels and other venues. Children&#39;s Art Carnival, Coalition of Institutionalized, Aged and Disabled (CIAD), Esperanza del Barrio, Families for Freedom, People&#39;s Production House, and Vision Urbana have received this grant.<br /><br />Maria Muentes, an organizer of Families for Freedom and a grant recipient of the MNN Training &amp; Production Grant said, “The MNN Community media grant will advance the voices of immigrant families facing and fighting deportation, by allowing them to get their voices to the public. Immigrant families speaking out about deportation is at the heart of everything we do, this will provide us with a new medium.”<br /><br />Decisions were made by a panel made up of community media advocates, media arts professionals, board and staff members who subscribe to MNN’s mission: To ensure the ability of Manhattan residents to exercise their First Amendment rights and create opportunities for mutual communication, education and artistic expression. The review panel considers issues of project sustainability, participation of the community represented, and the viability of the proposed budget in their final grantmaking decisions.<br /><br />For a detailed description of these projects, please visit<br /><a href=\"/en/grantees\">http://www.mnn.org/en/grantees<br /></a><br />"

Hundreds of Manhattan residents representing the diversity of the Borough testified and sent testimony in support of MNN, free speech, and a viable communications infrastructure for the public interest. <br />       <br /> Our collective voices were loud and clear and made sure the City of New York and the cable companies are well aware of the technological needs and interests of the residents of Manhattan. <br />       <br /> As a representative of one organization testified, “In this capital driven economy, it is encouraging to find an organization that provides the outreach and education that MNN provides for women and minority communities”. Access to media and technology is not a privilege, it is a right for all residents of the Borough. <br />       <br /> It was inspiring see all the community based organizations, youth and labor organizations, consumers groups, independent producers, elected officials, and friends who came out in support of MNN and free speech. <br />       <br /> In another breakthrough for MNN the hearings at BMCC were carried live on Channel 56. MNN&#39;s dedicated staff and management worked hard to bring this important hearing to all of the public and look forward to increasingly using communications technology to promote our public interest. <br />       <br /> The hearing was one of the first steps toward our upcoming franchise re-negotiation. The City’s Franchise and Concession Review Committee (FCRC), will take in consideration the testimony presented at the public hearing as they review and develop a renewal of the cable tv franchise. Your testimony helped lay the groundwork for our negotiations and showed the tremendous support for public access in our community. <br />       <br /> There are still some months before the City and the cable companies make public the status of the franchise renewal. As we learn more about the situation we will keep you informed and abreast of the progress of these negotiations, together we will make sure the franchise agreement is one that supports the needs and interests of all our residents. <br />       <br /> If you were not able to testify in person on February 7th, you can submit your comments related to the cable franchising process, <span class=\"bodytext\"> to future cable-related community needs/ interests or to the cable companies&#39; services or performance </span>directly  to the DOITT (Department of Information,Technology and Telecommunications) on-line at:<br />       <u><font color=\"#3333ff\"> <a href=\"http://www.nyc.gov/html/doitt/html/business/business_cable_tv_hearing_form.shtml\" class=\"moz-txt-link-freetext\">http://www.nyc.gov/html/doitt/html/business/business_cable_tv_hearing_form.shtml</a><br />       </font></u><br /> Thank you again for your support and commitment to free speech. </p>"

"MNN would like to thank everyone";"1212377221";"1212377221";"<p> MNN would like to thank everyone who came out to the New York City Cable Franchise renewal hearing on Thursday Feb. 7, 2008 at the Borough of Manhattan Community College. Hundreds of Manhattan residents representing the diversity of the Borough testified and sent testimony in support of MNN, free speech, and a viable communications infrastructure for the public interest. </p> <p><br /> Our collective voices were loud and clear and made sure the City of New York and the cable companies are well aware of the technological needs and interests of the residents of Manhattan. </p> <p><br /> As a representative of one organization testified, “In this capital driven economy, it is encouraging to find an organization that provides the outreach and education that MNN provides for women and minority communities”. Access to media and technology is not a privilege, it is a right for all residents of the Borough. </p> <p><br /> It was inspiring see all the community based organizations, youth and labor organizations, consumers groups, independent producers, elected officials, and friends who came out in support of MNN and free speech. </p> <p><br /> In another breakthrough for MNN the hearings at BMCC were carried live on Channel 56. MNN&#39;s dedicated staff and management worked hard to bring this important hearing to all of the public and look forward to increasingly using communications technology to promote our public interest. </p> <p><br /> The hearing was one of the first steps toward our upcoming franchise re-negotiation. The City’s Franchise and Concession Review Committee (FCRC), will take in consideration the testimony presented at the public hearing as they review and develop a renewal of the cable tv franchise. Your testimony helped lay the groundwork for our negotiations and showed the tremendous support for public access in our community. </p> <p><br /> There are still some months before the City and the cable companies make public the status of the franchise renewal. As we learn more about the situation we will keep you informed and abreast of the progress of these negotiations, together we will make sure the franchise agreement is one that supports the needs and interests of all our residents. </p> <p><br /> If you were not able to testify in person on February 7th, you can submit your comments related to the cable franchising process, <span class=\"bodytext\"> to future cable-related community needs/ interests or to the cable companies&#39; services or performance </span>directly  to the DOITT (Department of Information,Technology and Telecommunications) on-line at:</p> <p><u><font color=\"#3333ff\"> <a href=\"http://www.nyc.gov/html/doitt/html/business/business_cable_tv_hearing_form.shtml\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"moz-txt-link-freetext\">http://www.nyc.gov/html/doitt/html/business/business_cable_tv_hearing_form.shtml</a></font></u></p><p><u><font color=\"#3333ff\"> </font></u></p><p> Thank you again for your support and commitment to free speech. </p>"

"Public Access Centers Slam AT&T";"1233588811";"1234544096";"<p>Manhattan Neighborhood Network (MNN) joined a nationwide coalition of community media groups in filing a petition with the Federal Communications Commission on January 30, charging that telecom giant AT&amp;T discriminates against local public access channels with its U-verse cable TV system.<br /><br />The petition asks the FCC to rule that AT&amp;T&#39;s Public, Educational and Government (PEG) programming violates the 1984 Cable Act, as well as FCC rulings and policies.<br /><br />&quot;Relegating local, non-profit media channels to second-class status is a disservice to the public and violates both the spirit and letter of the law,&quot; said Helen Soule, executive director of the Alliance for Community Media in a press release.<br /><br />”AT&amp;T&#39;s treatment of PEG channels (in their U-Verse service) is inferior in virtually every way that matters to a viewer, preventing the public&#39;s ability to easily access safety alerts, town hall meetings, educational and other local programming,&quot; Soule continued.<br /><br />In states coast to coast, AT&amp;T&#39;s U-Verse system removes local PEG channels from the standard lineup, dumping dozens of channels into a generic &quot;Channel 99&quot; -- stripping away individual channel identities and depriving those channels of basic functions viewers have come to expect.<br /><br />The filing follows a sternly worded bipartisan letter from Congress to the FCC in September saying that changes in the cable TV industry should not lead to second-class status for PEG channels, according to the release.</p><p><br />&quot;PEG television is essential to our communities as an outlet for free speech, local information and opinions, and emergency communications,&quot; said the Sept. 30, 2008, letter signed by Rep. Jose Serrano (D-NY), the Chair of the House Subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government, ranking member Rep. Ralph Regula (R-Ohio) and Appropriations Chair David R. Obey (D-WI.)</p><p><br />Groups filing the claim represent community-based PEG centers, local governments and national associations from around the country dedicated to assuring that PEG channels and services are accessible to local residents, neighborhood groups, high schools, colleges, churches, civic groups and nonprofit organizations.</p><p><br />They include the City of Raleigh, North Carolina; the Sacramento, California, Cable Commission; the Illinois Chapter of the National Association of Telecommunications Officers and Advisors (NATOA) and public access centers such as Chicago Access Network Television (CAN TV), Brooklyn Community Access Television (BCAT) and BronxNet.<br /></p><p>For more info see http://www.ourchannels.org <br /></p>"

This long period without capital payments – more than 16 months now – has materially limited the CAO’s ability to provide public access television services to the community. </p>    <p class=\"MsoPlainText\">“Simply put, the longer the delay in negotiating a new agreement, the longer our CAOs are forced to operate under an outdated contract, without needed capital, and without sufficient support to meet our residents’ needs.”</p>    <p class=\"MsoPlainText\"><a href=\"/en/system/files/5+BP+FCRC+Letter.pdf\">To read the letter in full, click here.</a></p>  <!--EndFragment--> "

As the medium grows to encompass more screens, the thinking around distribution models for your content needs to grow as well. It is important to think of how the viewing habits of the audience change and what that means as part of this transition. With Social Media accounting for more online traffic than any other type of content, there is an increasing value to understanding how your online presence can impact your production. Have a YouTube account, Twitter feed and Facebook page but not sure how to use them to generate new viewers? This workshop will answer some of these questions while taking a further look at how a Social Media strategy can benefit your non-profit organization and help the group advance it's message to a wider audience.<br><br>When sharing your work online it is important to have an understanding of Intellectual Property law and how Creative Commons Licenses can help in having more people see your work. This workshop will take an in depth look at distribution methods and the differences between video sharing platforms such as YouTube and Vimeo. Other points of discussion will include how to shoot with the intention of distributing to the web, video compression for different platforms and best practices for embedding content into your site.<br><br><a href=\"/en/taking-your-show-air-online-how-social-media-can-h\">RSVP</a> is required for this workshop.<br><br><br>&nbsp;</p>"

"Thinking about HD Video";"1286894950";"1286981087";"<p>With great power comes great responsibility. This saying also holds true when talking about transitioning from standard definition video format to a high definition format.</p><p>One of the many things to keep in mind is that when you finally do make that transition, it’s not just having to choose which fancy new high def camera to buy but also what equipment you need to support your new workflow. For example, high definition files are usually bigger than standard definition files. Not only will you have to compensate for that by buying additional hard drives you also may have to upgrade your hardware. Just keep in mind that high def isn't a one size fits all format.</p>"

"A Quick Primer on HD Formats";"1288195978";"1292398902";"<p>High Definition Video (HDV) is a highly compressed recording format. It's a High Definition signal that can be recorded onto standard Mini DV tapes. The information generated by your HDV camera has to be compressed in order to fit the signal onto your tape. Generally, you will get high definition resolution in your footage but in scenes that have lots of fine detail, rapid movement or other complex activity like flashing lights, blurring may result.</p><p>AVCHD (Advanced Video Coding High Definition) is similar to HDV with some exceptions. First, it is a format that records to memory cards like SDHC cards or Memory stick cards. Another difference with AVCHD files are that they take a lot more processing power from your computer. Finally, you have some formats like DVCPRO HD or XDCAMEX which are less compressed. Because the recorded signal is less compressed there is more information and detail in your picture. It also means that your files are considerably larger.</p><p>&nbsp;</p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p> <!--EndFragment--><p>&nbsp;</p>"

These changes should not come at the expense of the diversity and vibrancy of local voices,&quot; Baldwin said.</p><p>&quot;These stations don&#39;t receive federal funding. All this bill does is allow and empower local communities to keep their public access channels if they choose to do so,&quot; said Congressman Steve LaTourette.</p><p>Historically, the number of channels and funding dedicated to PEG TV was negotiated as part of local cable franchise agreements between the cable company and the local community and each community determined its own investment in programming.</p><p>However, recent state-level franchise laws in twenty states have jeopardized this balance and communities and consumers in six states, including Wisconsin and Ohio, will lose all funding for PEG channels by 2012.</p><p>A nationwide study conducted for the <a href=\"http://benton.org/\" title=\"Benton Foundation and Public Access TV\" type=\"Benton Foundation and Public Access TV\">Benton Foundation</a> by the Alliance for Communications Democracy shows that PEG access centers in at least 100 communities across the U.S. have closed since 2005 and, without passage of the CAP Act, as many as another 400 public access channels will shut down.</p><p>Bookmark www.alliancecm.org for updates on the bill&#39;s progress and how you can help.</p>"
